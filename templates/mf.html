We have seen what foreign exchange is. We will go through the advantages of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange is required for international trade. When India is trading with the United States (US) both INR and USD are involved. If India is importing from the United States, it needs to pay in dollars. When the US is importing from India it would need to pay in rupees. Foreign exchange is also important when a country is investing in another. If the US is investing in India, it has to invest in rupees. Such transactions create a demand for foreign exchange. This is why the foreign exchange market is important.

        <p>
          A currency of a country is valued according to supply and demand. So, it always is in a state of flux. Such kind of exchange rate is known as floating exchange rate. This is the case in a free economy.

Similarly, the value of a rupee is determined by market forces. Factors like imports and exports, interest rates and inflation affect the value of the rupee. It would also depend on political conditions, internally and internationally. Tourism is another factor which influences foreign exchange value. This is why large companies have strategies to manage currency. The idea is to protect their business from currency fluctuations.
